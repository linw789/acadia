[ ] 3D transform gizmo
    [x] Draw translation arrows
    [x] Draw rotation circles
    [x] Draw dashed line for the arch that's behind the global.
    [ ] Implement pixel-accurate picking of gizmos.
        [x] Read object ids under the mouse cursor. 
        [x] Read the object ids from the second render target buffer from CPU.
        [x] Add a second render target to store object ids.
    [ ] Update object's translation based on the selected gizmo by mouse movement.
    [ ] Update object's rotation.
    [ ] Draw a pie on the rotation disk based on the rotation angle.
    [ ] Fade translation/scale gizmos if they become parallel to view direction.
    [ ] Draw scale hammers.
    [ ] Update object's scale scale gizmo is picked.
[ ] Remove color attribute from rotation gizmo vertex, and replace it with push constant.
[ ] Add reflection for push constants in shaders.
[ ] Add dirty flag in Camera, and update the matrix in get_pers_view_matrix() on demand. And pass
    &Camera where pers_view_matrix is passed
[x] Fix camera movement. It's too jumpy.
